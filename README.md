Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.:                   
  The project counts how many times each item in a grocery store's produce section is purchased in a single day. The purpose of the program is to allow the managers of a grocery store to analyze which products were purchased more often. The user is able to request a list of all the items and their frequency, request the frequency of a single item, or request a histogram comparing the frequencies of all the items.                                                                                           

What did you do particularly well?:                                                                                                                            
  I believe I did well iterating through the file in Python and handling the resulting data.                                                                             

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?:                                                      
  I feel like I could make the comments more clear and concise. Also, I am certain there is a better way to clear out cin when the user incorrectly enters a string, but I have not found it yet.                                                                                                                                                 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?:         
  I had some trouble opening the file to read. The main reason it was challenging was that I would not get any feedback. The program just skipped over the Python code and continued. To solve this issue, i first put some print statements in the problematic function to determine where the issue was. I found that the problem was with the line that I opened up the file. To further test, I wrote some C++ code that attempts to open the file, and if the file could not be opened it would print an error message. Confirming that for some reason the file couldn't be opened, my first thought was to move the file around in case I put it in the wrong folder, and that turned out to be the issue.                                                                                                                                                     

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?:                                                                       
  I have become more familiar with reading, writing, and managing files, which is a skill I hope to develop further as I make more projects. I better understand how Python and C++ interact with one another, and should I ever need to combine them for another project, I already have some experience.                                           

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?:                                                                                                     
  The program is simple and straightforward. It is made up of mostly self contained functions that can be adjusted without the need for extra adjustments elsewhere in the program.
